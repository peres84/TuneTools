# Kiroween Hackathon Rules

## Category: Frankenstein

Stitch together a chimera of technologies into one app. Bring together seemingly incompatible elements to build something unexpectedly powerful.

## Submission Requirements

### 1. Code Repository

- Provide a URL to your **open source code repository** for judging and testing
- Repository must be **public** with an approved **OSI Open Source License**
- **CRITICAL**: Your repo must contain the `/.kiro` directory at the root of the project to show usage of specs, hooks, and steering
- **DO NOT** add the `/.kiro` directory or sub-folders to your `.gitignore` - this could disqualify your submission

### 2. Functional Application

- Provide a URL to your **functional application(s)**
- You can provide login credentials in the public code repo if needed

### 3. Demonstration Video

- Include a **3-minute demonstration video** of your submission
- Videos must be uploaded to **YouTube, Vimeo, or Facebook Video** and made public
- Judges are not required to watch beyond 3 minutes
- **Identify which category and bonus category** you are submitting into

### 4. Kiro Usage Write-Up

Judges must understand how effectively you used Kiro to develop your project. Show us your next-level understanding of Kiro features:

#### Vibe Coding
- How did you structure your conversations with Kiro to build your project?
- What was the most impressive code generation Kiro helped you with?

#### Agent Hooks
- What specific workflows did you automate with Kiro hooks?
- How did these hooks improve your development process?

#### Spec-Driven Development
- How did you structure your spec for Kiro to implement?
- How did the spec-driven approach improve your development process?
- How did this compare to vibe coding?

#### Steering Docs
- How did you leverage steering to improve Kiro's responses?
- Was there a particular strategy that made the biggest difference?

#### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- How did extending Kiro's capabilities help you build your project?
- What sort of features or workflow improvements did MCP enable that otherwise would have been difficult or impossible?
