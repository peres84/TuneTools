## Tips & Best Practices

3. **Try custom titles**: Make songs more personal
4. **Connect calendar**: Adds personal context to lyrics
5. **Share your favorites**: Let friends hear your daily soundtrack

### Timing Recommendations

**Best time to generate**:
- **Morning**: Captures the day ahead
- **Evening**: Reflects on the day's events

**Avoid**:

Each song costs approximately **$0.09-0.23** to generate:
- RunPod GPU usage: ~7-12 minutes

**Recommendation**: One song per day is optimal.
